# Tawk.to Setup Guide for SkipTheQueue

## âœ… What's Already Done

I've already added the Tawk.to widget code to your `base.html` template. The widget will now appear on all pages of your website.

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Create Tawk.to Account

1. Go to [https://www.tawk.to](https://www.tawk.to)
2. Click "Get Started Free"
3. Sign up with your email address
4. No credit card required!

### Step 2: Get Your Widget Code

1. After signing up, you'll be taken to the dashboard
2. Click on "Administration" â†’ "Chat Widget"
3. Copy your unique widget ID (it looks like: `5f7d1234567890abcdef1234`)

### Step 3: Update Your Code

Replace `YOUR_TAWK_TO_WIDGET_ID` in your `base.html` file with your actual widget ID:

```html
<!-- Find this line in orders/templates/orders/base.html -->
s1.src='https://embed.tawk.to/YOUR_TAWK_TO_WIDGET_ID/default';

<!-- Replace with your actual ID, for example: -->
s1.src='https://embed.tawk.to/5f7d1234567890abcdef1234/default';
